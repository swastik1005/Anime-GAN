# AnimeGAN - Deep Convolutional GAN for Anime Image Generation

![AnimeGAN](https://github.com/swastik1005/Anime-GAN/issues/1#issue-2904972711)  

## Overview
AnimeGAN is a deep learning model trained using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate high-quality and visually appealing anime images. Built with PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook, this project explores the potential of GANs in synthesizing realistic anime-style artwork.

## Features
- Implemented a DCGAN architecture for anime image generation
- Trained using PyTorch for optimized performance
- Achieved an Inception Score of **2.0188** with a standard deviation of **0.2684** on small image sizes
- Demonstrates strong potential for generating high-quality content despite dataset constraints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
