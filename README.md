# AnimeGAN - Deep Convolutional GAN for Anime Image Generation

![AnimeGAN](https://github.com/swastik1005/Anime-GAN/issues/1#issue-2904972711)  

## Overview
AnimeGAN is a deep learning model trained using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate high-quality and visually appealing anime images. Built with PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook, this project explores the potential of GANs in synthesizing realistic anime-style artwork.

## Features
- Implemented a DCGAN architecture for anime image generation
- Trained using PyTorch for optimized performance
- Achieved an Inception Score of **2.0188** with a standard deviation of **0.2684** on small image sizes
- Demonstrates strong potential for generating high-quality content despite dataset constraints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Results
- The model successfully generates anime-style images after training on a dataset of anime characters.
- Achieved an **Inception Score of 2.0188** with a **standard deviation of 0.2684**, indicating strong generative performance even on small image sizes.
- The generated images exhibit sharp edges and distinct anime-like features, despite dataset constraints.
- Future improvements may involve training on a larger dataset to enhance image diversity and quality.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by various DCGAN implementations for anime image generation.
- Special thanks to the PyTorch community for extensive documentation and support.
- Acknowledging the creators of anime datasets used for training, which helped in refining the generative process.
